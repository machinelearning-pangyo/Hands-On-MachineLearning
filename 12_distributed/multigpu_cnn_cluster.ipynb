    "## Training with multiple GPU cards\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are using data parallelism to split the training accross multiple GPUs. Each GPU has a full replica of the neural network model, and the weights (i.e. variables) are updated synchronously by waiting that each GPU process its batch of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, each GPU process a distinct batch of data and compute the corresponding gradients, then, all gradients are accumulated in the CPU and averaged. The model weights are finally updated with the gradients averaged, and the new model weights are sent back to each GPU, to repeat the training process.\n",

The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image (28x28 pixels) with values from 0 to 1. For simplicity, each image has been flatten and converted to a 1-D numpy array of 784 features (28*28).\n",
